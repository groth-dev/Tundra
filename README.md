# What is Tundra?
On the surface level, Tundra is a template for empty Unity projects to build your projects on top of. It has already laid out file structure, assemblies and modules. Beyond just this, Tundra provides a philosophy on how games should be programmed and structured. You can see this throughout the packages and custom modules used. This is not meant for a small hobby game, but instead it is designed by industry professionals to promote a scalable and managable style of game development.

# Versions
## Arctic
Very basic template that only includes the file structure and premade assembly definitions needed for adhering to the philosophical principles. Does not contain any code at all, and is the perfect starting place if all you need is a fresh slate.

## Glacier
Builds on top of the file structure laid out in Arctic and introduces third party packages that are used to further the development experience. These packages greatly improve the game development experience and should almost be considered as a core part of Unity itself.

## Permafrost
Includes custom made libraries that covers the boiler-plate side of game development that all games will use in some way. Greatly increase your productivity by focusing on programming the actual game and not by re-inventing the wheel for the 10th time.
